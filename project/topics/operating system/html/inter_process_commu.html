    <h1 class="headerr"> Inter-process Communication</h1>
</div>
<br>
<p>In general, Inter Process Communication is a type of mechanism usually provided by the operating system (or OS). The main aim or goal of this mechanism is to provide communications in between several processes. In short, the intercommunication allows a process letting another process know that some event has occurred.</p>
<p>"Inter-process communication is used for exchanging useful information between numerous threads in one or more processes (or programs)."
</p>
<p> <p><h3 class="headerr"> Role of Synchronization in Inter Process Communication </h3></p></p>
<p>It is one of the essential parts of inter process communication. Typically, this is provided by interprocess communication control mechanisms, but sometimes it can also be controlled by communication processes.</p>
<p>These are the following methods that used to provide the synchronization:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
<li>Mutual Exclusion</li>
<p>It is generally required that only one process thread can enter the critical section at a time. This also helps in synchronization and creates a stable state to avoid the race condition</p>
<li>Semaphore</li>
<p>Semaphore is a type of variable that usually controls the access to the shared resources by several processes. Semaphore is further divided into two types which are as follows:
<div style="margin-left: 50px;" ><li>Binary Semaphore</li> 
    <li>Counting Semaphore</li> </p></div>
   
<li>Barrier</li>
<p>A barrier typically not allows an individual process to proceed unless all the processes does not reach it. It is used by many parallel languages, and collective routines impose barriers.</p>
<li>Spinlock</li>
<p>Spinlock is a type of lock as its name implies. The processes are trying to acquire the spinlock waits or stays in a loop while checking that the lock is available or not. It is known as busy waiting because even though the process active, the process does not perform any functional operation (or task).</p>

</div>


<p> <p><h3 class="headerr">Approaches to Interprocess Communication </h3></p></p>
<p>These are a few different approaches for Inter- Process Communication:</p>

<p> <p><h4 class="headerr">Pipe:-</h4></p></p>
<p>The pipe is a type of data channel that is unidirectional in nature. It means that the data in this type of data channel can be moved in only a single direction at a time. Still, one can use two-channel of this type, so that he can able to send and receive data in two processes. Typically, it uses the standard methods for input and output. These pipes are used in all types of POSIX systems and in different versions of window operating systems as well. </p>


<p> <p><h4 class="headerr">Shared Memory:- </h4></p></p>
<p>It can be referred to as a type of memory that can be used or accessed by multiple processes simultaneously. It is primarily used so that the processes can communicate with each other. Therefore the shared memory is used by almost all POSIX and Windows operating systems as well.</p>


<p> <p><h4 class="headerr">Message Queue:- </h4></p></p>
<p>In general, several different messages are allowed to read and write the data to the message queue. In the message queue, the messages are stored or stay in the queue unless their recipients retrieve them. In short, we can also say that the message queue is very helpful in inter-process communication and used by all operating systems.</p>

<p> <p><h4 class="headerr">Message Passing:- </h4></p></p>
<p>It is a type of mechanism that allows processes to synchronize and communicate with each other. However, by using the message passing, the processes can communicate with each other without restoring the hared variables.</p> 

   <p>Usually, the inter-process communication mechanism provides two operations that are as follows:</p>  
        <div style="margin-left: 50px;" >
           <li>  send (message)</li>
            <li> received (message)</li>
         </div>


<p> <p><h4 class="headerr">Direct Communication:- </h4></p></p>
<p>In this type of communication process, usually, a link is created or established between two communicating processes. However, in every pair of communicating processes, only one link can exist.</p>


<p> <p><h4 class="headerr">Indirect Communication </h4></p></p>
<p>Indirect communication can only exist or be established when processes share a common mailbox, and each pair of these processes shares multiple communication links. These shared links can be unidirectional or bi-directional.</p>

<p> <p><h4 class="headerr">FIFO:-</h4></p></p>
<p>It is a type of general communication between two unrelated processes. It can also be considered as full-duplex, which means that one process can communicate with another process and vice versa.</p>

<p> <p><h3 class="headerr">Why we need interprocess communication?</h3></p></p>
<p>There are numerous reasons to use inter-process communication for sharing the data. Here are some of the most important reasons that are given below:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 50px;" >
    <li>  It helps to speedup modularity</li>
     <li>   Computational</li>
     <li>Privilege separation</li>
<li>Convenience</li>
<li>Helps operating system to communicate with each other and synchronize their actions as well.</li>
