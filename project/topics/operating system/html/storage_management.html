    <h1 class="headerr">Storage Management </h1>
</div>
<br>
<p>Storage Management is defined as it refers to the management of the data storage equipment’s that are used to store the user/computer generated data. Hence it is a tool or set of processes used by an administrator to keep your data and storage equipment’s safe.</p>

<p>Storage management is a process for users to optimize the use of storage devices and to protect the integrity of data for any media on which it resides and the category of storage management generally contain the different type of subcategories covering aspects such as security, virtualization and more, as well as different types of provisioning or automation, which is generally made up the entire storage management software market.</p>
<p> <p><h4 class="headerr">Feature of Storage management:</h4></p></p>
<p>There is some feature of storage management which is provided for storage capacity. These are given below:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">

<li>Storage management is a process that is used to optimize the use of storage devices.</li>
<li>Storage management must be allocated and managed as a resource in order to truly benefit a corporation.</li>
<li>Storage management is generally a basic system component of information systems.</li>
<li>It is used to improve the performance of their data storage resources.</li>

</div>
<br>
<p> <p><h4 class="headerr">Advantage of storage management:</h4></p></p>
<p>There are some advantage of storage management which are given below:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 25px;">

<li>It is very simple to managed a storage capacity.
</li>
<li>It is generally take a less time.</li>
<li>It is improve the performance of system.</li>
<li>In virtualization and automation technologies can help an organization improve its agility.</li>

</div>
<p></p>
<p> <p><h2 class="headerr">File System Concept</h2></p></p>
<p>Computer store information in storage media such as disk, tape drives, and optical disks. The operating system provides a logical view of the information stored in the disk. This logical storage unit is a file.
</p>
<p>
    The information stored in files are non-volatile, means they are not lost during power failures. A file is named collection of related information that is stored on physical storage.
    </p>

<p>Data cannot be written to a computer unless it is written to a file. A file, in general, is a sequence of bits, bytes, lines, or records defined by its owner or creator. The file has a structure defined by its owner or creator and depends on the file type.
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
<li><b>Text file –</b> It has a sequence of characters.</li>
<li><b>Image file – </b> It has visual information such as photographs, vectors art and so on.</li>
<li><b>Source file –</b> It has subroutines and function that are compiled later.</li>
<li><b>Object file –</b> It has a sequence of bytes, organized into bytes and used by the linker.</li>    
<li><b>Executable file –</b> The binary code that the loader brings to memory for execution is stored in an exe file.
</li>
</div>
<p></p>
<p> <p><h4 class="headerr">What are File Attributes in OS?</h4></p></p>
<p>File attributes are configuration and information related to files. These attributes grant/deny requests of a user/process for access, modifying, relocating, or deleting it. Some common examples of file attributes are:
</p>
<div style="margin-left: 25px;">
    <li><b>Read-only:</b>  Allows a file to be only read.</li>
    <li><b>Read-Write: </b> Allows a file to be read and written to.</li>
    <li><b>Hidden:</b> File is made invisible during non-privileged regular operations.</li>
    <li><b>Execute:</b>  Allows a file to be executed like a program. Other than these there are several attributes. Many of them are platform-specific.</li>    
    
    </div>
<p></p>

<p> <p><h3 class="headerr">file Type</h3></p></p>
<p>It refers to the ability of the operating system to differentiate various types of files like text files, binary, and source files. However, Operating systems like MS_DOS and UNIX has the following type of files:
</p>

<p> <p><h4 class="headerr">Character Special File</h4></p></p>
<p>It is a hardware file that reads or writes data character by character, like mouse, printer, and more.
</p>

<p> <p><h4 class="headerr">Ordinary files</h4></p></p>
<p>These types of files stores user information.
    It may be text, executable programs, and databases.
    It allows the user to perform operations like add, delete, and modify.</p>

    <p> <p><h4 class="headerr">Directory Files</h4></p></p>
<p>Directory contains files and other related information about those files. Its basically a folder to hold and organize multiple files.</p>

<p> <p><h4 class="headerr">Special Files</h4></p></p>
<p>These files are also called device files. It represents physical devices like printers, disks, networks, flash drive, etc.</p>

<p> <p><h4 class="headerr">Functions of File</h4></p></p>
<div>
    <li>Create file, find space on disk, and make an entry in the directory.</li>
<li>Write to file, requires positioning within the file</li>
<li>Read from file involves positioning within the file</li>
<li>Delete directory entry, regain disk space.</li>

</div>



<p><b>Reposition:</b>move read/write position.</p>
<p>Commonly used terms in File systems</p>
<p><b>Field:</b></p>
<p>This element stores a single value, which can be static or variable length.</p>
<p><b>DATABASE:</b></p>

<p>Collection of related data is called a database. Relationships among elements of data are explicit.</p>
<p><b>FILES:</b></p>
<p>Files is the collection of similar record which is treated as a single entity.</p>
<p><b>RECORD:</b></p>
<p>A Record type is a complex data type that allows the programmer to create a new data type with the desired column structure. Its groups one or more columns to form a new data type. These columns will have their own names and data type.</p>
